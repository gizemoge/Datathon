We developed a machine learning prediction model with multiple linear regression to observe the impact of health, labor force participation, gender roles, and political representation on wage inequality in the context of gender roles. Additionally, we investigated the influence of gender roles on job placement using a logistic regression model.

For the analysis, we used:
- Seaborn, Matplotlib and Plotly for data visualization,
- Heat maps to demonstrate feature correlations,
- Scikit-learn library for the machine learning steps.
